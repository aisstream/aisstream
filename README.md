### Welcome to the official Github account of aisstream.io :ship:

Hello! [aisstream.io](https://aisstream.io) is a free api to stream global AIS data via websockets. With our AIS data stream you are able to track vessel position, identity, port calls and much more. 

If you decide to use aisstream in a project, app, or company please open a issue [here](https://github.com/aisstream/Projects-Using-aisstream.io). We would love to hear what aisstream.io is currently being used for!
